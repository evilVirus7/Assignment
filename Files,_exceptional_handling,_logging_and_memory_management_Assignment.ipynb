        "\n",
        "a. **Resource Management:**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you open a file, the operating system allocates system resources like file handles and memory buffers.\n",
        "\n",
        "By closing the file, you release these resources back to the system, preventing resource leaks and ensuring efficient utilization.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. **Data Integrity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you write to a file, data is often buffered in memory before being written to the disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Closing the file ensures that all buffered data is flushed to the disk, preventing data loss or corruption.\n",
        "\n",

        "Some file operations, like writing, require exclusive access to the file.\n",
