        "Ans- The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Classes: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Objects: Objects are instances of classes. They represent real-world entities and have their own unique state (values of their attributes) and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on that data within a single unit (class). This helps in protecting the data from unauthorized access and modification, promoting data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "d. Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (child class or subclass) inherits the properties and methods of another class (parent class or superclass). This promotes code reusability and creates hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "e. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as if they were of the same type. This can be achieved through method overloading (different methods with the same name but different parameters) or method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass with the same name and parameters as in the superclass)."
